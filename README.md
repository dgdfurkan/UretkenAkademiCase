## **Exploring Unity: Üretken Akademi Experience**

As an aspiring game developer, I have always been fascinated by the power of Unity, a leading game development engine. To enhance my skills and deepen my understanding of this robust platform, I recently had the privilege of attending a Unity tutorial at Üretken Akademi. The knowledge and insights gained from this training have been invaluable, thanks in no small part to the exceptional instruction provided by the talented tutors.

**Unveiling Fine Details**

What truly impressed me about the instructor was their attention to detail. They took the time to delve into the intricacies of Unity, unraveling its vast potential one feature at a time. From the basics of game object manipulation to the more advanced scripting techniques, each lesson was meticulously crafted to provide a comprehensive understanding of Unity's capabilities.

**Sharing the Journey**

Throughout the training, I make it a point to capture moments of learning and discovery. The images, videos, and GIFs share here represent snippets of the vibrant learning environment at Üretken Akamedi. These visual glimpses not only serve as a memento of the incredible journey but also showcase the dedication and expertise of both the instructor and my fellow learners.

## Week 1 Course Content and Task

- Topic 1: Unity and Visual Studio Installation
- Topic 2: Unity Hub and First Project
- Topic 3: Toolbar
- Topic 4: Hierarchy
- Topic 5: Inspector
- Topic 6: Assets
- Topic 7: Field of View
- Topic 8: Scene View
- Topic 9: Game Tab
- Topic 10: Layouts
- Topic 11: Levels
- Topic 12: Asset Store
- Topic 13: Console
- Topic 14: Outputting

 The task for this week was to download and add one of the free 3D assets from the Asset Store to the scene. This assignment allowed us to explore the vast collection of available assets and incorporate them into our project, enhancing the visual quality and overall experience. By utilizing the Asset Store, we were able to save time and effort by leveraging the work of talented artists and developers within the Unity community. Adding 3D assets not only adds depth and realism to our scenes but also provides us with a broader range of creative possibilities. It was an exciting opportunity to explore the diverse options in the Asset Store and select an asset that aligned with the vision of our project. This task enabled us to enhance our skills in asset integration and expand our understanding of utilizing external resources to elevate our game development projects.

The task for this week was to create a script in Unity that takes two integer parameters and calculates the multiples within the range of those integers. This assignment allowed us to practice writing functions that perform calculations based on input parameters. By defining a function with two integer parameters, we were able to dynamically determine the range for finding the multiples. Implementing this functionality not only enhanced our understanding of script creation in Unity but also improved our problem-solving skills. The script we developed was able to efficiently determine and display the multiples within the specified range, providing us with a practical tool for future projects. This task further strengthened our proficiency in programming logic and reinforced the importance of parameterized functions in game development.

## MultiplyValues.cs

```csharp
void GenerateMultiples(int minNumber, int maxNumber, int multiplier)
{
  if (multiplier <= 0)   // Multiplier must be positive
  {
    Debug.Log($"Multiplier ({multiplier}) must be positive");
    return;
  }
  else if (multiplier > maxNumber)   // Multiplier must be lesser than MaxNumber
  {
    Debug.Log($"Multiplier ({multiplier}) must be lesser than MaxNumber ({maxNumber})");
    return;
  }

  if (maxNumber < minNumber)   // MaxNumber must be higher than MinNumber
  {
    Debug.Log($"MaxNumber ({maxNumber}) must be higher than MinNumber ({minNumber})");
    return;
  }

  for (int i = 1; i <= multiplier; i += 1)   // Starts from 1 to Multiplier
  {
    string multiples = $"Multiples of {i}: ";
    for (int j = minNumber; j <= maxNumber; j++)   // Starts from MinNumber to MaxNumber
    {
      if (j % i == 0)
      {
        multiples += j + ", ";
      }
    }
    Debug.Log(multiples.TrimEnd(',', ' '));   // After for print all values, Trim.End delete the last ","
  }
}
```
